# XanFi-Project
A DeFi project that aims to ease creation of investments in crypto by the creation of indexes/funds made up of crypto assets.
The idea behind the project is to be able to create 'funds' that are made up underlying crypto assets to help in the following and others
1. Track the performance of crypto assets that maybe similar
2. Have a risk tolerant portfolio by essentially owning different crypto assets
3. Get a portfolio easily(especially for beginners)

Basicly the Dapp would allow the creation of a new token that represents a pool of other crypto assets,
take for example a user wants to track/own metaverse project tokens
but does not want to always hold them in his wallets, he could create a new 'index' token that essentially has say
20% of token1, 40% of token2 and 40% token3
this means that the new token is a combination of token1, token2 and token3 but then if token1 losses alot of value
or the price goes down, the price of the newly created token might not go down alot because the prices of token2 and token3 have either remained
the same or gone up.

Thus this new 'index' token can be transfered to anyone since it will be an ERC20 standard token, and anyone who holds the token might be able to redeem
the underlying assets of the the 'index' token.
Since these 'index' tokens can be created by any user, the template for the for the creation of the token can be used by other users
to make the same token(actually purchasing them).
